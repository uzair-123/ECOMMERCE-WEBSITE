# ECOMMERCE-WEBSITE

This ecommerce website , I made using PHP, MYSQL. This website contains Add to Cart, guest checkout functionalities.

## Installing this application is fairly easy, just follow these steps:

1) Import/load ecommmerce.sql into your mysql database. This should set up the basic structure of the database system.

2) Modify the config.php and change the variables to match your host, database, username and passwords.

3) Then run on any browser using Xampp, or wamp for localhost

Good luck!
